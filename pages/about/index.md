      I made this site mostly because I wanted to mess around with Tailwind CSS, partly because I needed
      a spot to share my photos without compressing the details out of them, and partly because I still have
      a few college essays left in me. Basically, it’s my personal space to build stuff and write without
      worrying about deadlines.

      I read a lot about a wide range of topics. Some useful, some obscure, all interesting (to me, anyway).
      I’m pretty good with computers, and I credit an early-childhood video-game addiction for honing my
      problem-solving skills.
