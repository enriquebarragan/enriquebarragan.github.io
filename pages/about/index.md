  <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    I made this site mostly because I wanted to mess around with Tailwind CSS, partly because I needed a spot to share my photos without compressing the details out of them, and partly because I still have a few college essays left in me. Basically, itâ€™s my personal space to build stuff and write without worrying about deadlines.
