      This website is just my personal space to build stuff and write without
      worrying about deadlines.<br><br>
      
      I made this site mostly because I learned how to use Tailwind, partly because I needed
      a spot to share my photos without compressing the details out of them, and partly because I still have
      a few college essays left in me.

      I read a lot about a wide range of topics. Some useful, some obscure, all interesting (to me, anyway).
      I’m pretty good with computers, and I credit an early childhood video game addiction for honing my
      problem solving skills. If you need any help with anything, lmk!
