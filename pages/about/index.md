      I made this site mostly because I wanted to mess around with Tailwind CSS, partly because I needed a spot to share my photos without compressing the details out of them, and partly because I still have a few college essays left in me. Basically, it’s my personal space to build stuff and write without worrying about deadlines.

      I read a lot about a wide range of topics—some useful, some obscure, all interesting (to me, anyway). I'm pretty good with computers, and I credit an early childhood video game addiction for honing my problem-solving skills.
