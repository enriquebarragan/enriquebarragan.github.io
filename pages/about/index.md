      I made this site mostly because I wanted to mess around with Tailwind CSS,
      partly because I needed a spot to share my photos without compressing the details out
      of them, and partly because I still have a few college essays left in me.
      Basically, it’s my personal space to build stuff and write without worrying about deadlines.

      I read a lot about a wide range of topics. Some useful, some obscure, all interesting
      (to me, anyway). I’m pretty good with computers, and I credit an early childhood
      video‐game addiction for honing my problem-solving skills.
